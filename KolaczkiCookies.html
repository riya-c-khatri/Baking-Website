    <h1>Kolaczki Cookies</h1>
    
    <h2>Ingredients (For 2-3 Dozen Kolaczki Cookies):</h2>
    
    <h5>⅔ cup sugar</h5>
    <h5>1 cup butter</h5>
    <h5>8 ounces cream cheese</h5>
    <h5>A pinch of salt</h5>
    <h5>1 egg</h5>
    <h5>2 tsp vanilla extract</h5>
    <h5>2 1/3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more as needed</h5>
    <h5>⅓ cup jam of your choice (apricot and strawberry recommended)</h5>
    <h5>Powdered sugar, for decorating</h5>
    
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <p>Note: The mixing in this recipe can be done by hand, using a hand mixer, or in a stand mixer (recommended).</p>
        <li>Cream the sugar with the butter and cream cheese until combined and smooth.</li>
        <li>Mix in the salt, egg, and vanilla extract until combined.</li>
        <li>Add the flour and mix until combined. Note: The dough will be slightly sticky to the touch. If it sticks excessively to your hands, sprinkle some more flour.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate the dough for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325°F and line a baking tray with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>On a floured surface, roll the dough out to ⅛-inch thickness and cut into 2 ½-inch squares. If the dough sticks, sprinkle some more flour.</li>
        <li>Spoon a small dollop of jam onto the center of each square. Fold two opposite corners together and gently press to seal.</li>
        <li>Bake for 22 minutes. Note: Cook time may vary depending on the oven.</li>
        <li>Optional: Dust the kolaczki cookies with powdered sugar.</li>
        <li>Allow the cookies to cool slightly before serving, as the jam will be very hot.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
