    <h3>For the Cinnamon Roll Dough:</h3>
    <h5>⅓ cup warm milk, more as necessary</h5>
    <h5>1 tsp yeast</h5>
    <h5>2 cups King Arthur All Purpose Flour, more as necessary</h5>
    <h5>¼ cup sugar</h5>
    <h5>A pinch of salt</h5>
    <h5>3 tbsp butter</h5>
    <h5>1 egg</h5>
    
    <h3>For the Cinnamon Roll Filling:</h3>
    <h5>4 tbsp butter</h5>
    <h5>⅝ cup brown sugar</h5>
    <h5>2 tbsp cinnamon</h5>
    
    <h3>For the Cream Cheese Icing:</h3>
    <h5>4 tbsp butter</h5>
    <h5>1.3 oz cream cheese</h5>
    <h5>¾ cup powdered sugar</h5>
    <h5>A pinch of salt</h5>
    <h5>¼ tsp vanilla extract</h5>
    <h5>1 tsp milk (if needed for desired consistency)</h5>
    
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <li>Warm the milk. Mix in the yeast and wait 5-10 minutes until slightly frothy.</li>
        <li>Add the flour, sugar, salt, butter, and egg to the bowl of a stand mixer and mix for 2 minutes until incorporated. Then add the milk-yeast mixture little by little.</li>
        <li>Note: Add a few drops of milk if the dough is tough and not binding. If the dough is too sticky, sprinkle some flour.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough for 5-10 minutes in the stand mixer.</li>
        <li>Oil a large bowl to place the dough in. Cover and place the dough in a warm place for 1-2 hours so it can rise.</li>
        <li>Roll the dough out into a 12-inch x 10-inch rectangle with an approximate thickness of ¼ inch. The width and height of the rectangle can vary at this stage.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter and spread over the dough. Combine the brown sugar and cinnamon. Sprinkle over the dough.</li>
        <li>From the long end of the dough, roll it up. Then cut 12 cinnamon rolls out.</li>
        <li>Place the cinnamon rolls in a buttered pan. Cover and let them rise for another 30 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F and bake the cinnamon rolls for 15-20 minutes. When they are golden brown, they are ready.</li>
        <li>Mix all the icing ingredients together with a hand mixer. Even if it seems like the ingredients are not binding, keep mixing for about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Note: If the icing looks too thick to spread, add a few drops of milk.</li>
        <li>As soon as the cinnamon rolls are out of the oven, spread them with icing.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
